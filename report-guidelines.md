The following gives some tips on how to write sections in the final project report. These can also serve as guidelines for appropriate formats for answering questions in the weekly lab reports.

It is also very helpful to look at real published papers (e.g. the paper you will be using for your project) to see specific examples of how these sections are typically written.

Your final lab report should have:

* **Title**:  A descriptive title that indicates the topic of the project
* **Abstract**:  In no more than 100 words, briefly summarize what was done in the project, what the findings were, and why they were important.
* **Introduction**:  In 2-3 paragraphs, provide enough background information to understand the biology behind the project. Be sure to state what problem or question the project addresses, and why it is important. You must cite at least one scientific journal article for this section. When you use outside resources, use in-text citations in the text attributing any ideas or information from materials outside of our course lecture or tutorial.
* **Methods**: This section should contain sufficient information so that other bioinformaticists could reproduce your results. You should briefly describe your raw data (what is it, what is the name of the reference) and describe what you did with it. You should write this in 2-3 paragraphs, not in a list. When you use a bioinformatics software program, do not write out the full command you typed, but do specify which program (ie ‘bwa-mem’ or ‘samtools tview’) you used and whether you used the default options. If you did not use the defaults, you should specify the exact settings you used. The first time you mention bioinformatics
software or an online tool, you should cite it and specify which version of the tool you used. The correct citation for most software can be found by looking up its documentation online (you don’t have to cite common tools like python or perl or the bash shell). If you write a custom script, say so.
* **Results**:  This section should include the results of your data processing and data analysis, and may include tables with read lengths, pictures of quality distributions, or tables of gene names for examples. Your report will also contain the results from the main paper you are trying to reproduce! In the text, briefly restate how you got the results in full sentences, but in less detail than the methods, before you say what the results are (ie ‘reads were mapped to the reference and scanned to identify positions that likely contained mutations. We found….’). Refer to tables and figures by number, and include a brief descriptive title for each. The results section should be as objective as possible, so please refrain from interpreting the meaning or significance here. It should be just the facts. 
* **Discussion**:  In 2-3 paragraphs, explain what you think the results mean, and
why you are interpreting them this way. If you encountered any problems, or
answered questions, discuss them and suggest ways to solve them with future
experiments or analyses. 
the tutorial. 
* **Citations**:  You can use any commonly used format you like, but be consistent. Reports will thoroughly examined for plagiarism, so be sure to cite other people’s ideas, and put everything in your own words (paraphrasing) if you aren’t using direct quotes.
