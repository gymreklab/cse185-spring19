# Accessing assignments

1. Go to [datahub.ucsd.edu](datahub.ucsd.edu). Log in with your active directory account (UCSD Google account)

2. Spawn the CSE185 course.

3. Click on the "Assignments" tab

4. Look for released assignments and "fetch" the assignment.

5. Once fetched, you should be able to see the individual notebook files for each lab. Click prelab 1 to begin!

# Submitting assignments

From the assignments tab, for each notebook, you can click "Validate" to check that you pass all autograder tests (including hidden ones)

When you are ready to submit the assignment, simply click "Submit"

# Turning in assignments late

* Submissions are due on Mondays 11:59:59 PM
* Late submissions will be accepted until 4 days after the deadline (Friday 11:59:59 PM)
* 5 points (out of 100) will be deducted for each late day
* Only the grade on the latest submission will be considered. For example, if the grade received for the lab submitted before the deadline is higher than the grade received on the latest submission, then the lower grade will be considered. So please do not click "submit" again after you have submitted the version you want to be graded.

# Regrades

This is the first round of using JupyterHub for grading assignments, and we recognize there are still some kinks to work out in the grading process.

So we will be allowing regrades of lab assignments but you must specify exactly which questions you believe were graded incorrectly and justify why you think you should get points back.

You must ask for regrades within one week of receiving feedback for the assignment.

Please request regrades through private Piazza messages to ensure we see them.
