# CSE185 Spring 2019 Lab Guidelines

For the first 7 weeks, we will work on a different lab assignment each week during the Tuesday and Thursday lab sessions. Lab reports are due the following Monday before the start of class.

Each lab will require you to have access to the joint class server for data analysis and to JupyterHub for completing preclass assignments and reports. Detailed instructions are given below.

## Connecting to the server
If you already have a UCSD username on `ieng6.ucsd.edu`, you should be able to log in with that. To activate a course specific account, go to: https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php.

Once you've obtained a username, you can log into the server from the terminal using ssh:
```
ssh $username@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

This will take you to your course home directory (`/home/linux/ieng6/cs185s/$username`). All materials for the course will be provided in the `/home/linux/ieng6/cs185s/public` directory each week.

If you are logging in with your UCSD username, you will need to run the `prep` command to active the cse185 course environment.

## Accessing the pre-lab and lab assignment on JupyterHub

TBD

## Working in groups

Pre-class assignments must be completed individually. You may work with a partner on the main lab assignments, but **you must work with a different person each week**. At the top of your own assignment indicate who your partner was and which of you is submitting the assignment. Only one of you needs to turn in the complete lab assignment. 


## Grading

Each lab consist of 10% of the final grade. Pre-class assignments are worth 2% and main lab assignments are worth 8%.
