# CSE185 Spring 2019 Lab Guidelines

For the first 7 weeks, we will work on a different lab assignment each week during the Tuesday and Thursday lab sessions. Lab assignments are due the following Monday before the start of class.

Each lab will require you to have access to JupyterLab through datahub.ucsd.edu. Our first lab assignment will involve getting set up on this system.

## Working in groups

Pre-class assignments must be completed individually. You may work with a partner on the main lab assignments, but **you must work with a different person each week**. At the top of your own assignment indicate who your partner was and which of you is submitting the assignment. Only one of you needs to turn in the complete lab assignment. 


## Grading

Each lab consist of 10% of the final grade. Pre-class assignments are worth 2% and main lab assignments are worth 8%.
