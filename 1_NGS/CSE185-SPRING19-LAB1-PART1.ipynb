The earliest alignment algorithms (Smith Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch) are still used today to compare small pieces of DNA one-by-one, but the computing power needed to map millions of short reads to genomes that are millions to billions of basepairs long requires special algorithms to speed up the process.\n",
